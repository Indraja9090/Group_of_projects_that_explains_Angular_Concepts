/*By setting `enableTracing` to `true`, you will see detailed logs in the browser's console for each navigation event,
                         including navigation start, route activation, guards activation, and navigation end.

/*When navigation occurs in an Angular application, various events are triggered in the routing pipeline. These events include:

1.Navigation Start: This event occurs when the navigation starts. 
                        It is triggered before the route is resolved and guards are activated.

2.Route Activation: This event occurs when the route is successfully matched and activated.
                         It involves the instantiation and initialization of the components associated with the route.

3.Guards Activation: This event occurs when guards (such as CanActivate or Resolve) are activated and evaluated.
                         Guards are used to control access to routes or to fetch data before activating a route.

4.Navigation End: This event occurs when the navigation is complete. 
            It signifies that the route has been successfully activated and the corresponding components have been rendered.

By enabling tracing, you can observe the sequence of these events in the console, 
        along with additional information such as the time taken for each event and the route configuration.

Tracing navigation events can be particularly useful when debugging complex navigation scenarios,
                 identifying performance bottlenecks, or understanding the routing process in detail.*/
