/*EXPLANATION: `HttpHeaders()` are immmutable
        At `createProduct()` - When we created an instance to `HttpHeaders()` 
                                    we simply passed an object to `HttpHeaders()` constructor 
    But At `fetchProduct()` - When we are creating an instance to `HttpHeaders()`
            on this instance of `HttpHeaders()` we are calling the chain of `set()` methods specifying headers to `get()` request
        NOTE that 1st `set()` will return a new instance of http REQUEST headers(where defined headers will be set) 
                                without changing the existing instance */

/*We have `append()` method jsut like we have `set()` method

        The chain of `set()` methods returns the new instance after mofiying the given header
            That is,  If a header with the specified name already exists, the existing value is replaced with the new value. 
                                                                                        If the header does not exist, it is added. 
        The `set()` method returns a new `HttpHeaders` object with the updated headers.
            Syntax:    set(name: string, value: string | string[]): HttpHeaders: 
    EXAMPLE: 
        const headers = new HttpHeaders();
        headers = headers.set('Content-Type', 'application1/json');
        headers = headers.set('Content-Type', 'application2/json');


The `append()` method is used to add a new header value for a given header name, without replacing any existing values.
     If a header with the specified name already exists, the new value is appended to the existing values. 
     The append() method returns a new HttpHeaders object with the updated headers.
Example: 
    const headers = new HttpHeaders();
    headers = headers.append('Accept', 'application1/json');
    headers = headers.append('Accept', 'application2/json');

The `Accept` header is appended with the value `application/json`. If the `Accept` header already existed with other values, 
                                the new value is added to the existing values.
*/
                

/*The `map()` operator is applied to the response data. 
    It transforms the response data into the desired format before emitting it as the output of the Observable. 
    The map() operator takes a callback function as an argument, which is executed for each emitted value. 
    The callback function in this code is an arrow function `(response) => { ... }` .*/

/*using the spread operator `{...response[key]}` spreads the values of response[key] (the product properties) into a new object . 
The `id property is added to the new object with the value `key`. 
This creates a new object that includes all the original product properties along with an additional id property.*/

/*The `for...in` loop in JavaScript is used to iterate over the properties of an object. 
    It allows you to loop through all the enumerable properties of an object, 
            including its own properties and properties inherited from its prototype chain.

IMPORTANT NOTE : The `for...in` loop iterates over enumerable properties, including properties inherited from prototypes. 
    To iterate only over an object's own properties (excluding inherited ones), we can use the `hasOwnProperty()` method 
                                                                            to check if a property belongs directly to the object.
The syntax of the for...in loop:
            for (key in object) {
                if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
                    // code to be executed
                }
            }
The `key` is a placeholder for each property name that is being iterated over. 
                    It represents the current property name in each iteration of the loop.

The `object` is the object whose properties you want to iterate over.

Inside the loop, you can access the value of each property using the `object[key]` syntax.*/
